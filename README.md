## Math game project
This project is my first C# project, where I've developed a Math Game following guidelines from [The C# Academy](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/53/math-game).
It was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The code is kept as clean as possible. (Tried to apply patterns and heuristics from my software engineering 1 class, where i code them in smalltalk)
